# SpamSmsDetection
Welcome to the Spam SMS Detection project!
This project builds a machine learning model to automatically detect and classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam).

Task Objectives:
• The objective is to develop an SMS classification model that identifies spam messages.
• The dataset consists of labeled messages categorized as spam or non-spam. 
• Expected Outcome: A robust model that accurately distinguishes between spam and legitimate messages, with well documented preprocessing and classification approaches.

Steps to Run the Project:
1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/YEDLAMANASA/SpamSmsDetection.git
   cd SpamSmsDetection/spamdetection
2. Install the Required Libraries Install all the libraries using:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk seaborn matplotlib pickle5
3. Prepare the Dataset:
   Place your spam.csv file (downloaded dataset) in the project directory.
   Make sure your dataset has the columns v1 (label) and v2 (message)
4. Run the Python Script:
   python spamsmsdetection.py
5. Expected Outcome: A robust model that accurately distinguishes between spam and legitimate messages, with well documented preprocessing and classification 
   approaches.
